## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

The positioning of the socials popup isn't the most fluid on desktop sizes, some overall refactoring would be required.


### Useful resources

- [CSS Filter Generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - Applies a filter to svgs to change their visible color
